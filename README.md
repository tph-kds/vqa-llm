## Model Overview

### Introduction

Building a multi-model usually is a difficult challenge that scientists want to explore and conquer. With the quick development of technology and algorithms, the majority of current approaches can be easier than the previous time. This project was created with a big desire to bring many valuable results when merging many large language models (LLM) together and deeply related knowledge.    

VQA model is a deep neural network that learns and responds to users when they provide questions and related images, the model will answer reliance on those information. Namely, as below images:

## Getting Started

### Install Required Packages
(It is recommended to install the dependencies under Conda environment.)  
* python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9  
* tqdm  
* pytorch==0.4.0
* torchvision
* cython
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy
* pyyaml
* packaging
* pycocotools
* tensorboardx
* h5py
* opencv-python
* streamlit
* pillow # for PIL

**The required supportive environment uses a hardware accelerator GPUs such as T4 of Colab, GPU A100, etc.**

### Prepare the Training Data

Name | #Image | #Question | #Answer
| :------:| :------: | :------: | :-----: |
Train | 5000 | 248350 | 248350
Validation | 2500 | 121513 | 121513
Test | 2500 | 107395 | 107395

All of orignal file are formatted in JSON files, after handling data processing, they has formatted in CSV files.

The csv files have some attribution:

```json
[
    {
        "image_id": int,
        "question": str,
        "question_id": int,
        "answer" : str
    }
]
```


### Download Based Models

Google - Bert ( textual_feature_extractor ): BERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. [Available on this link](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased)


Google - ViT ( visual_feature_extractor ): The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. [Available on this link](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k)


## Inference And Demo


### Results

| Data | #WUPS | #MRR | #Loss |
| --- | --- | --- |  --- |
| [Train]() | 0.23114 |	0.32561 | 4.52219 |
| [Validation]() | 0.23152	|  0.32828 |	5.18071 |


### Deployment on HuggingFace

I used Streamlit Framework for deploying this model but only run locally, if wanting run on server of HuggingFace, we need to register model (because of this model builded from scratch) [more information](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/custom_models)

### Future Plans

- Fine-tune on a larger dataset
- Evaluation on downstream tasks
- Experiment with different model sizes
- Experiment with different serving frameworks: vLLM, TGI, Triton Inference Server, etc.
- Experiment with expanding the tokenizer and prepare for pre-training

Stay tuned for future releases as we are continuously working on improving the model, expanding the dataset, and adding new features.
